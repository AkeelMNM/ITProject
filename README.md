## <a name="intro-project"></a>Introduction

This web based “Factory Management System” is design to overcome some of the current manual systems problems and inefficiencies of the tea producing factories. This system is constructed to cover the factory’s overall management processes, such as Purchase Management, Inventory Management, Production Management, Human Resource Management, Sales Management and Payroll Management.  The best part is the web based system makes it easier and possible to monitor the factory processes from any location. 
 
The System is developed to meet user and system requirements. The system would help Tea Factory’s management to be in controlling and handling the operations. It also help factory administration to function efficiently and this newly implemented web based system will allow profit maximization.
